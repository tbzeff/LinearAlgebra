# LinearAlgebra

W.I.P.
Made with help from ChatGPT.

A Haskell library I made for representing and working with Vectors and Matrices. Many basic linear algebra operations are implemented such as matrix-matrix multiplication, vector-matrix multiplication, dot product, projection and finding the determinant of a matrix. A few algorithms are also implemented such as the Gram-Schmidt process for finding an orthonormal basis and QR decomposition.

TODO:
- Identify and fix where numerical precision errors are introduced in computations
- Algorithm to determine whether a set of vectors are linearly independent
